Cathedral
=========

This game was created as a semester project for the AI class. And it didn't win the competition.

A word of warning
-----------------

If you happen to come across this project while you're preparing for an implementation of this board game yourself: **Go away now!**
This implementation sucks at playing this game. In fact it is also cheating. I am posting this here just for kicks.

Only for the brave (or stupid)
------------------------------

- The game is configured for one AI and one human player (see Definitions.java if you want to change that)
- figure the rest out for yourself or open an issue
